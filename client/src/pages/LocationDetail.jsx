The islands are built on a foundation of coral reefs and feature white sand beaches, turquoise lagoons, and house reefs perfect for snorkeling.

Islam is the state religion, introduced in 1153 AD. Traditional music, dance, and crafts like lacquerwork and mat weaving are still practiced. The concept of 'resort islands' separate from local communities helps preserve traditional Maldivian culture while providing world-class tourism experiences.",
